# Purpose

These days I wear a number of hats in my professional and personal life. I've noticed that most of the work I do has very poor documentation and references available online. This was not the case when I had a job and a career path to follow. To hold myself accountable , to my goals, and my partners, I started this blog. I write every week to reflect on how well I've done in the past week, what I should consider next week, and whether there are any major learnings I've gained.
